Dust Bowl stories usually focus</span>  on the warm months. When I was growing up, many were the times that I heard my parents, grandparents, or other relatives talk about the winter of 1936 — especially when winter rolled around. At that time it was the coldest and snowiest winter on record. The 35-day period from January 19th to February 22nd, still stands as the coldest in this part of the world. The average high temperature was 8 degrees and the low was -13 degrees. The mean temperature was -2.5 degrees and 25 inches of snow fell.	    </p>
		<p>Earlier that winter, things were different — briefly. The first 18 days of December were mild with readings above freezing on fourteen of those days. Then from the 19th to the 30th, the temperature remained below freezing. Christmas day saw 6 inches of snow on the ground and a low of -12 degrees. Readings were below zero every morning from the 24th to the 30th. The month averaged 2 degrees below normal and there were at least 8 inches of snow.</p>

		<p>A storm on January 21st-22nd was especially intense. It deposited 7 inches of snow and the temperature fell four to five degrees every hour until it reached -26 degrees with strong winds. It was so cold that the noon whistle would not blow. On the 23rd the high was -14 degrees and the low was -28 degrees. Most roads were impassable with north and south roads being blocked by six to eight foot high drifts. </p>
		<p>The temperature stayed below zero from the evening of the 21st through the morning of the 28th, a total of 160 hours. More snow and wind on the 29th through the 30th blocked the roads again. The lows were below zero every morning from the 19th through the 31st.</p>
		<p>The bitter cold continued into the month of February. A blizzard swept the area on the 4th, dropping 7 inches of snow and bringing high winds. The main highways were blocked by 5-foot drifts, bringing traffic to a standstill. There was no mail service on the 5th, a day when the thermometer registered -28 degrees, water pipes were frozen, and the Chicago Northwestern trains coming from the east were delayed several hours. To make matters worse, on the 7th, the winds picked up again and by nightfall, the roads were impassable yet one more time that winter. </p>
		<p>Another blizzard struck the area on the 8th, bringing four inches of snow and high winds to the area. The temperature fell 30 degrees in just one hour. Due to the snow and lack of coal used for heating, the schools were closed for the next two weeks. Purchase of it was rationed and it was sold by the bushel basket. The train between Tipton and Stanwood did not run for two weeks. It took two engines and a large snowplow to open the track line.</p>
		<p>Up to three weeks after the February storm, many roads throughout the county remained closed, which is no surprise considering the drifts were as high as the telephone wires in some places. 150 WPA workers were hired to open the roads with scoop shovels. Farmers cut the fence wires so they could drive their bobsleds through the fields. </p>
		<p>The winter of 1936 that my parents and grandparents remembered so well averaged a temperature of 11.5 degrees. For 46 days the temperature did not climb above zero. The snowfall totaled 45 inches. The fact that coal was scarce and people resorted to heating only two or three rooms in their homes meant that it was cold both inside and out. For those who experienced it, the winter of 1936 in Cedar County was hard to forget.</p>

		<p>The first two weeks of January were again rather mild, with six of those days above freezing. Five inches of snow did fall from the 4th to the 8th, but the high on the 14th was 43 degrees. It would be the last day above freezing until February 23rd. A storm on January 16th-17th dumped 5 inches of snow. The thermometer fell to -10 degrees on the 19th and registered below zero every morning until February 12th. </p>
