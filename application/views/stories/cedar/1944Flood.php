	    <p><span class="lead_in">As the battle for Normandy raged in Europe,</span> people on the home front in Cedar County found themselves with a different kind of fight on their hands. Bodies of hogs and chickens dotted the water surface south of Lowden after a 24-hour, 10-inch rain caused extensive flash flooding on June 26, 1944.  It was probably the worst flood in Cedar County’s history. Like the Lowden area, the area east of Tipton also received 10 inches. The storm was accompanied by some hail and high winds that damaged trees and farm buildings. The Clarence area received 7.50 inches of rain, most of which fell between 7 and 9:30 A.M. on the 26th of June. Only the extreme southern part of the county escaped the deluge. </p>

	    <p>Almost every creek in the county was flooded — washing out fences and flooding fields. Soil erosion was extremely severe, especially on more hilly ground. There was substantial loss of livestock and poultry along the larger streams. One farmer living in Lime City lost 150 head of sheep. On the Gust Licht farm one half-mile from Lowden, water was standing five feet deep in his buildings. He lost 30 hogs that were swept away in the Yankee Run Creek. He also lost all of his fences and hundreds of bushels of corn that were ruined by mud. Two other farmers south and east of Lowden lost livestock that were carried away by the high water. </p>
	    <p>Several main highways were blocked by high water and washed out bridges. Travel could only be accomplished with much detouring and backtracking. There were 96 damaged bridges — 56 completely taken out and 34 had approaches washed out to a degree that left them impassable. Cedar County residents couldn’t easily evacuate and couldn’t communicate with others either. The phone service was disrupted by downed telephone lines.</p>

	    <p>Railroad service was badly disrupted across the county with passenger and mail trains rerouted far to the north or south. Service was suspended on the Chicago and Northwestern railway for 2 days because of a washed out bridge between Clarence and Stanwood. The Rock Island Line suspended service due to a bridge washed out at Moscow.</p>
	    <p>Scenes of devastation greeted the eye on all sides but no human lives were lost.</p>

        	<p>The storms hit the Lowden area late Sunday afternoon on the 25th of June and then again early Monday morning. All three creeks — Yankee Run, Indee and East Creek — went on the rampage and by midmorning on Monday, the surrounding area for several miles was completely under water and traffic was at a standstill. The homes in the west, south and east parts of Lowden were surrounded by water. Some homes in the west part of town were flooded over the main floor. The east wall of a basement collapsed in the west part of town. One home had water over the tabletop. Several families were evacuated, some by boat. The highway was flooded for several miles, blocking the westbound train. The Conrad and Conrad lumber yard and buildings were standing in two feet of water.</p>
