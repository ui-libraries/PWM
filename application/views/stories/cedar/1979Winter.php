	    <p><span class="lead_in">For those living in Cedar County in 1979 </span>who remembered the winter of 1936, the winter of 1978-79 might have seemed familiar and different. Roads were repeatedly impassable — but delayed trains were no longer an issue; school was closed for weeks — but not for lack of coal to heat them. In fact the 1979 winter would surpass the winter of 1936 with colder temperatures and more snow. </p>
	    <p>The winter began on November 26-27 in 1978, with 4.4 inches of snow. The month of December began with more white stuff falling on the 2nd, accompanied by lightning and thunder. 10.7 inches accumulated. Another 2.2 inches fell on the 5th and one inch fell again on the 7th. Every day from the 28th to 31st snow fell, totaling 15.5 inches. December alone produced 30.5 inches of snow, a record. The snows of November and December remained until March 25, 1979 — a total of 120 days. Some of the snowdrifts remained well into April. </p>
	    <p>The cold air settled in from December 8th to 10th with lows from -12 to -16 degrees. Milder weather dominated from the 11th to the 20th with daily highs above freezing and little precipitation before the weather turned colder and wetter again. Morning lows were from 0 to -3 degrees from the 24th to the 27th. The high of 34 degrees on the 29th would be the last above freezing reading until February 20th. The month of December averaged 4.7 degrees below normal with seven days of 0 degree readings. </p>

	    <p>On the 24th, the thermometer was down to -10 degrees with 42 mph winds. January ended as it began with impassable roads and impossible travel.</p>
	    <p>January 1979, with an average of 1.7 degrees, is the coldest on record in Cedar County. We had 24 days with 0 degree readings and 6 days with the high temperatures failing to get above 0 degrees. The 37.9 inches of snow was a record also. </p>
	    <p>On February 1st, only 5% of the county roads were opened to two lanes of traffic. Some farm families were stranded for several days. The National Guard was called in with their heavy equipment to open the county roads. They used their helicopter to airlift hay to stranded livestock. The state brought in two snow blowers to open the blacktopped roads but some of the snow on the gravel roads was so hard that the blowers did not work. For several weeks there was no school.</p>
	    <p>As January turned into February, Cedar County residents must have hoped for a change in the weather. Instead, the month of February got off to a cold start with readings below zero every morning from the 1st to the 10th. Lows ranged from -1 to -23 degrees. Four of these mornings saw readings of -20 or colder. There were 2.3 inches of snow on the 7th to 8th blown around by 32 mph winds. The weather was colder again from the 15th to 19th with lows of 0 to -18 degrees. Finally, the thermometer rose above freezing on the 20th  of February, the first time in 52 days. February’s average temperature was 8.7 degrees, the second coldest in Cedar County. February 1936 was colder. 16 days showed 0 degree readings; on three of those days the highs failed to get above zero. There were 8.7 inches of snow. </p>

	    <p>After A New Year’s Eve storm, the weather turned bitterly cold — reading below zero from the 1st to the 11th. The mercury dipped below zero on the evening of the 1st and did not rise above the magic point until the afternoon of the 5th. This was a total of 93.5 hours. The lows during that period ranged form -10 to -25 degrees with seven of those being -20 or colder. Wind chills were from -20 to -70 degrees. </p>
	    <p>Snow began falling on the 11th and continued through the 13th, totaling 19.0 inches, 14.6 inches on the 13th alone. On that day, a full-blown blizzard raged with NW winds gusting to 43 mph and wind chills down to -40 degrees. The winds continued throughout the next day, bringing the thermometer down to -22 and, with wind chills, as low as an arctic -75 degrees. With snowdrifts 10 to 15 feet high, all roads were impassable. Many cars were stranded on Interstate 80 in the southern part of Cedar County. Tipton housed 140 stranded travelers. </p>
	    <p>Although Tipton residents were hospitable, the rest of the January, 1979 was not. Another 2.1 inches of snow fell on the 15th ; 4.1 inches, on the 18th and 19th ; 6.3 inches, on the 23rd; 4.5 inches, on the 26th and 27th. Intense cold and strong winds persisted. The morning lows from the 14th-18th were between -7 and -23 degrees. </p>
