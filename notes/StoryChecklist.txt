- Set up County Menu and landing page (if not already done)
    - Open menus.xlsm in the resources/csv folder (enable macros)
    - Find the county name in menu_items and make note of the id
    - switch to “menus” sheet and create a new menu line using the id
      found in menu_items, and the county name for menu_desc. Unless it
      is a special case, the other fields should duplicate entries in
      the other county menu items
    - add sort
    - in the menu_views spreadsheet, include the menu_item id and the
      name of the view (generally the county name)
    - Set Local Submenu
        - At the bottom of the menu_items add county menu id to
          child_of field
        - add menu id with trailing zeroes to id field
        - at minimum add home and reset menu item
        - add other menu items and submenu items depending upon
          available materials
    - Currently create a new county page from county template.php in
      the views folder.
        - Future I think this will be a generic template into which we
          pass values
    - Set coords and magification.
        - Run macro to save menus stylesheets as csv
        - comment map on click event in county view
        - run admin page and Load menus 
        - find coordinates of desired view by  trial and error
        - update county view with coordinates and zoom level
- Find coordinates for event
    - Lat, Lon : 41.60748491954806, -95.78181266784668
- Marker
    - If marker is point type
        - Choose marker icon image 
        - resize to approx 120px (smaller if many markers to occupy the
          same map area)
        - copy to PWM/resources/image/<county name>/popups
- Popup
    - Choose popup image
    - Size to somewhere around 300px
        - Make note of width
    - copy to PWM/resources/image/<county name>/popups
- Open PWM/resources/csv/popups.xlsx (enable macros)
    - Duplicate last line
    - popups
        - give it a descriptive name
        - set maxwidth to popup image width +20 px
        - set minwidth to popup image width.
    - popups content (defines the content of the popup window)
        - Set title to type of event and year
        - Set subtitle to location
        - Add optional body text
        - add url to imageurl
            - this will be the relative url starting at the
              PWM/resources/image folder
        - add url to buttonurl
            - This will be the uri to the view file
              home/story/harrison/<story name>
    - popups_icons (defines the icon and location that  will be used
      for the popup marker)
        - If the popup_markers.type = point (not polyline or polygon)
            - icon name - choose descriptive name
            - iconurl - path to the icon image e.g.,
              harrison/popups/LoganIcon.jpg
            - iconsize_x, iconsize_y
                - generally enter the full size of the icon file
            - iconanchor_x, iconanchor_y
                - can be used to adjust the location of the marker in
                  relationship to the event coordinates. Measurement is
                  in pixels
        - if the popup_markers.type != point (polyline or polygon)
            - icon name - choose descriptive name
            - icon url - set to “none”
        - popupanchor_x, popupanchor_y
            - can be used to adjust the location of the popup window in
              relationship to the marker (i think, but may be in
              relationship to the  event coordinates). Measurement is
              in pixels
            - desc
                - add a description of the popup icon so that you
                  recognize which one it is on the map
    - popups_markers
        - marker_name - give the marker a descriptive name
        - Layergroup
            - If there will be more than one layer on the map, include
              layer group names, otherwise leave blank
        - Indicate marker type
            - point, polyline, polygon, [circle not yet implemented]
        - coords
            - enter the lat and lng coordinates for the event
              determined in step 1
            - For Point events, enter lat, lng in the form
              yy.yyyyy,x,xxxxx
            - for polylines and polygibs events use
              [yy.yyyyy,x,xxxxx],[yy.yyyyy,x,xxxxx],…
    - popups_views
        - Enter the name of the view for this story (generally the
          county name)
        - markername, iconname, popupname should be filled in
          automatically
        - offset_x. offset_y can be used to reposition the popup window
          (a little bit unsure of what the difference between this and
          popupanchor_x
    - Run SaveWorksheetsAsCSV Macro
    - Import the popups into the map using this address
        - Local Address: http://localhost:8888/PWM/index.php/admin
        - Server Address http://PeoplesWeatherMap/index.php/admin
- Prep images
    - Color balance and contrast (generally the “auto” settings for
      both of these in photoshop are pretty good)
    - Correct any rotation problems
    - Crop to eliminate edges
    - Save full size
    - Save for Web at Width 500px
        - Target size below 150K
- Build Story Page
    - Start with template.php in the stories folder
    - Save file in the appropriate county folder using the Event
